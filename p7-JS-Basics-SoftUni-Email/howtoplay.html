		<p>This is a version of the popular game <a href="http://www.alderac.com/loveletter/">Love Letter</a> by Seiji Kanai. The goal in the original game is to send your love letters to the Princess, using the other characters as carriers of your letters. Once you've sent enough love letters to the Princess, you win her heart and, as per tradition, 50% of the kingdom. Every character card has its unique effect and you should get the best of it in order to reach your goal.</p>
		<p>This version of the game uses SoftUni as a main theme, and in particular - the hunt of Mr. Nakov for successful students. We're also kinda fans of the Batman franchise, so we thought it would be fun to do a crossover using characters from there instead of the real names of the people on the cards.</p>
		<p>The rules are pretty straight-forward: there is a total of 16 cards. In the beginning, one card is set aside, and every player gets one card from the remaining deck. First player is determined randomly. At the beginning of each player's turn, a second card is drawn from the deck and then the player chooses which card to play, along with a target. Every card contains full description of its action. Game ends in one of two ways: either all players but one are out from the round, or, once the deck is empty, all players still in the round compare the values of their cards. The player with the highest (usually the 8) wins the round. In a 4-player game, whoever wins 4 round wins the game.</p>
